Hi, I'm Soham!

### Experience

My favourite languages are Python, C++, Rust, Dart, and Julia. 

I have extensive experience with Linux configuration - especially in non-Systemd based distributions. I'm a huge runit fan. My favourite distro is Artix - I love the AUR but enjoy the increased modularity of Artix systems.

### Interests

I love photography, music, and visual art. I take a lot of photos on old film cameras, and love experimenting with alternative development methods.

I also collect prints and graphics from old Japanese photographers, my favourites being Daido Moriyama, Masahisa Fukase, and Tatsuo Suzuki. 

I also love the work of Fan Ho, Zhou Han Shun, and László Moholy-Nagy. If you're interested, I'd highly recommend viewing the work of all these artists, as they have shaped generations of modern design and visual art.
